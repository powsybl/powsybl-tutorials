# Topology tutorial
In this tutorial, we learn how to build a substation in node/breaker topology and how to change from this node/breaker view to a bus/breaker view. In this tutorial, we also learn how to build this same voltage level directly in bus/breaker topology.
This tutorial is fully described in the user-story [topology](https://www.powsybl.org/docs/user_stories/topology.html).
